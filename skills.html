<ul class="list">
    <li>c/c++</li>
    <p >I have extensive knowledge of C++ and C programming languages, including an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming concepts. I have completed over 100 coding questions in C++ on LeetCode, which has further strengthened my problem-solving skills and my ability to write efficient and clean code. I am confident in my ability to write programs using C++ and C, and I am constantly working to improve my skills in these languages.</p>
    <li>Html/css</li>
    <p>I have strong knowledge and experience in HTML and CSS web development. I have created several web pages, including a weather website, voice assistant, calculator, portfolio, restaurant website, and chat application, which have honed my skills in both front-end design and back-end functionality. Through my experience in web development, I have developed a keen eye for detail and a problem-solving mindset, as well as the ability to create visually appealing and user-friendly designs. I am constantly learning and keeping up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in web development, and I am eager to continue building upon my skills in this field.</p>
    <li>Javascript</li>
    <p>I have a solid understanding of JavaScript, which I have used as a scripting language in all of my projects. My proficiency in JavaScript has allowed me to create dynamic and interactive web pages with ease. I have experience using JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as React and Node.js, which have further broadened my knowledge of this language. Through my projects, I have developed a strong problem-solving ability and a detail-oriented mindset, both of which are essential for efficient coding. I am always eager to learn more about JavaScript and the latest technologies in web development, as I am committed to becoming an even more skilled and versatile developer.</p>
