            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hi, my name is Hemant Soni. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications from JECRC University. As a computer science student, I have a strong passion for problem-solving and competitive coding. I have completed a C++ playlist on HackerRank and have also solved over 100 questions on LeetCode.

                In addition to coding, I have a keen interest in staying up-to-date with the latest technological advancements and innovations. I am always eager to learn and apply new skills in my work. I believe in taking on challenges and approaching them with a positive attitude, which has helped me achieve success in my academic pursuits.
                
                When I am not coding, I enjoy spending my free time on hobbies like reading, playing sports, and listening to music. I am also involved in community service activities and believe in giving back to society whenever possible.
                
                I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and look forward to contributing my skills and knowledge to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</p>
